## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- (none yet)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Research identified key risks to track:

- **Annotation divergence**: OT guarantees document convergence but not position convergence. Comment/revision anchors may drift. Mitigation strategy needed before Phase 8.
- **Relay must use rebaseUpdates**: Demo server rejects stale versions. Production relay must implement rebaseUpdates from day one (Phase 4).
- **Per-user undo required**: Multi-user editing needs per-user undo stacks. Must tag operations with author in Phase 6.
