# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-04-16)

**Core value:** Two Quillium instances can connect and see each other's edits in real-time
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — relay-core

## Current Position

Phase: 5
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 04
Last activity: 2026-04-17

Progress: [..........] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 9
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- (none yet)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Research identified key risks to track:

- **Annotation divergence**: OT guarantees document convergence but not position convergence. Comment/revision anchors may drift. Mitigation strategy needed before Phase 8.
- **Relay must use rebaseUpdates**: Demo server rejects stale versions. Production relay must implement rebaseUpdates from day one (Phase 4).
- **Per-user undo required**: Multi-user editing needs per-user undo stacks. Must tag operations with author in Phase 6.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
